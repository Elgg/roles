This plugin does three things:

- It allows admins to create, edit and delete roles through a "Manage roles"
link added to the admin sidebar.

- It allows admins to assign roles to specific users through a form added to 
the admin area of each user profile page (one checkbox per role).

- it adds each role to the access control dropdown box so that any user
(not only admins) can restrict the visibility of content to users with a 
specific role.

Admins can create as many roles as they like and each user can
have multiple roles.

Admins and the owners of entities can always view those entities even if they 
are restricted to a role they do not have.

There are many further directions roles can take now that they exist. This
may just be the beginning.
